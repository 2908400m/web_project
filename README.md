## Before you start

You will need to have **Python 3** installed, if you don't - please install it before continuing.

The app reqires certain packages to run:
- certifi==2025.1.31
- charset-normalizer==3.4.1
- coverage==7.6.12
- Django==2.2.28
- dotenv==0.9.9
- idna==3.10
- pillow==11.1.0
- python-dotenv==1.0.1
- pytz==2025.1
- redis==5.2.1
- requests==2.32.3
- spotipy==2.25.1
- sqlparse==0.5.3
- urllib3==2.3.0

**!! Note !!** : It is important to install the exact package versions we specified in requirements.txt (and
just above) as using an older/newer version might not be compatible and cause unstable work of the app.


Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the reqired packages for the app

```bash
pip install –r requirements.txt
```

Now when all the requirements are met you can run the project.
